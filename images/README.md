## Contents

1. **actual_vs_predicted_prices.png**: 
   - A scatter plot comparing the actual prices against the predicted prices from the regression analysis.
   - The red dashed line indicates the ideal scenario where actual prices equal predicted prices.

2. **residuals_plot.png**: 
   - A plot showing the residuals (errors) of the regression model.
   - This visualization helps to assess the model's performance by displaying the differences between predicted and actual values.

3. **clusters.png**: 
   - A cluster plot visualizing the results of the K-Means clustering.
   - Different colors represent distinct clusters based on annual income and spending score, providing insights into customer segments.
